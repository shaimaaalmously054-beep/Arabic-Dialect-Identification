# Arabic Dialect Identification

## Description
This project focuses on identifying the dialect of Arabic text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The main goal is to handle multi-dialect Arabic text, clean and preprocess it, and classify it accurately.

## Objectives
- Work with multi-dialect Arabic texts.
- Understand the challenges of dialect identification.
- Analyze data patterns without reading all texts manually.
- Preprocess and normalize text for classification.
- Apply different vectorization methods and machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate the impact of preprocessing on classification accuracy.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP libraries (NLTK, SpaCy, etc.)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaimaaalmously054-beep/Arabic-Dialect-Identification.git
